                    favour of Nehru at the request of Gandhi The election's importance stemmed from the fact that the

                <p>"It is the prime responsibility of every citizen to feel that his country is free and to defend it
                    freedom is his duty. Every Indian should now forget that he is a Rajput, a Sikh or a Jat. He must
                    remember that he is an Indian and he has every right in his country but with certain duties"</p>
